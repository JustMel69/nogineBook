# Introduction

**[Nogine](https://github.com/JustMel69/nogine)** is a 2D Game Development framework made in pure Rust.

One of the main design principles in **Nogine** is minimizing the number of dependencies that need to be compiled in order for it to work.

(This book assumes you have basic proeficiency with the Rust programming language. If you don't, check out the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/))

# Warning

**Nogine** quite literally has just come out of the oven, so bugs, performance issues and poor design is to be expected. It is not recommended to build any serious long term project with it.
